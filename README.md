# art-herb

Hi, I’m Art Herb. I’m a design coder based in Sydney, Australia. I make things look good and work smoothly. I love blending design and code to create simple, clean experiences that just feel right.

I focus on creating designs that are functional and beautiful. I care about the little details, the ones that make a difference when you’re using something. Not just looking at it. If you’re after something that works seamlessly and looks good while doing it, I’m your person.

Let’s make something awesome together.
